  p.description
    | The Table element represents data in two dimensions or more. We encourage the use of proper formatting with
    = ' '
    code thead
    |  and
    = ' '
    code tbody
    |  to create a
    = ' '
    code table
    | . The code becomes cleaner without disturbing understanding.
